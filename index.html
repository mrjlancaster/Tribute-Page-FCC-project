                    <div class="content">
                    <h3>1. Mentored by the great Aristotle</h3>
                    <p>Amongst all the people in the world and history, Alexander happened to have been mentored by Aristotle, and trained in philosophy. We all hear about Aristotle growing up and learn the history in school. But Alexander's teachings we don't hear about (at least not that I remember of)</p>

                    <h3>2. Tamed the untamed horse</h3>
                    <p>Bucephalus, a horse that would buck all comers who tried to mount him, but not alexander. With alexander's attention to details, he noticed that the reason the horse was so frightened and bucked all comers was because he'd see his own shadow and be scared. So Alexander made a bet with his father telling him that he could mount that horse. Alexander turned Bucephalus the horse torwards the sun, where the horse couldn't see his own shadow, and there alexander was able to climb Bucephalus.</p>

                    <h3>3. Alexander took over the Persia empire</h3>
                    <p>With an army of 50,000 men, alexander marched towards Hellenspot to face King Darius (Darius the Great). King Darius with an army of a total of more than 2.5 million men, took 250,000 men to battle Alexander. But with Alexander's tactics and strategy, he created a distraction attracting Darius army's away from himself, then being able to send a calvary attack to where Darius was located in the middle of the battle line, and Alexander's cousin murdering Darius. After that, Alexander became the new King of all Persia.</p>

                    <h3>4. He was a visionary</h3>
                    <p>Alexander had a vision of conquering the entire world. And he did! By the end of his life, the Macedonian empire ruled for three centuries, and now Alexander being consider an action Hero.

                    <h3>Death</h3>
                    <p>After all the battles, and the conquers, at the age of 32 years old Alexander died of Malaria.</p>
